# Silentbridge
Original toolkit by Gabriel Ryan ([@s0lst1c3](https://twitter.com/s0lst1c3)) @ SpecterOps (gryan@specterops.io).

This version is an implementation and update of the toolkit for a RaspberryPi 3 running Rasperrypi OS.

Silentbridge is a toolkit for quickly bypassing 802.1x port security first presented at DEF CON 26. It provides the first documented means of bypassing 802.1x-2010 via its authentication process, as well as improvements to existing techniques for bypassing 802.1x-2004.
